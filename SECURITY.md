# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in my project, I encourage you to report it right away. I'll investigate all reports and do my best to quickly fix the problem.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability?

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/Bradawan/CyberRoulette/security/advisories/new) tab.

### What to Include in Your Report?

Your report should include details of:

- The vulnerability type and its potential impact.
- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if possible).

### What to Expect After Submitting a Report?

After you submit a report, I will respond to acknowledge receipt of your report and I will follow up with any additional questions. Once the issue is assessed, I will notify you of our evaluation and any actions we plan to take.
